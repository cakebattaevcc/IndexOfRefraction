The goal of this code is to process data from our experiment where we added sugar to water and progressively tested the index of refraction.
The code was created with quite a bit of back and forth using ChatGPT, mostly for figuring out function names and stuff like that. I learned a bit of syntax along the way too (i.e. adding f before a string).
